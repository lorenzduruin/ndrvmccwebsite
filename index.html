  <center><h1>Welcome to the Notre Dame - RVM College of Cotabato</h1></center>
  
  <div class="content">
  <b>Notre Dame - RVM College of Cotabato </b> is an institution accredited by TESDA that offers Technical and Vocational
  Education and Training Programs (TVET) under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and the Commission
  on Higher Eudcation (CHED). It is a private school run by the Religious of the Virgin Mary.
  
<h1>History</h1>
Its beginning from the <b>Escuela Catolica</b> founded by the Beates (now RVM Sisters) S. Isabel Cero Mojado, S. Valentina Lorenzo, S. Filomena Galos, and S. Severina Santos who were sent by the Superior General of the Beatas, Reverend Elfigenia Alvarez, 1904. The first classes were held at the home of Don Antonio and Do&ntilde;a Eusebia Sousa, the generous benefactors of the Sisters. In 1917, the school obtained the government recognition and was granted the authority to issue certificates to the elementary school graduates. The subjects taught were Christian Doctrines, Reading and Writing, Drawing and Painting, and Home Arts for Girls. Until 1911, all instructions were in Spanish. When English became the medium of instruction, Spanish continued to be taught as a subject in all levels.<br><br>

The school underwent several name changing from Escluela Catolica to Esuela de San Antonio, Colegio de los Corazones why Maria and finally Cotabato Parochial School which it bore until World War I stopped its operation.<br><br>

In, 1947, Archbishop Mongeau, then the O.M.I. Father Superior, founded the Notre Dame of Cotabato a co &mdash; educational Catholic High School which in 1948 was separated into Boy&acute;s Departments and Girls Department. The Marist Brothers, taking over the Boys remain in the original site of the sister&acute;s School and the Sisters themselves, under the leadership of S. Ma. Isabel Purification moved to the Notre Dame of Cotabato for Girls Department. In 1979, Notre Dame of Cotabato for Girls Department finally became Notre Dame of Cotabato for Girls.<br><br>

In 1984, the grade school department started to accept boys, while in 2000 the high school department had its group of boys, too. After three years, that is, in school year 2002&mdash;2003, the school underwent another change of name, Notre Dame &mdash; RVM School of Cotabato which it presently bears.<br><br>

The years that followed were milestones to remember in the history of this institution. Various improvements happened under the leadership of S. Ma. Zosima N. Capua, RVM, the Directress. It saw the competition of the four-storey Mother Ignacia Building which housed the fourth year classes, the air-conditioned library.<br><br>

With the school&acute;s endless desire to improve and offer the community a better quality of service in the field of education, it opened its portals to college education for school year 2003-2004. Two short term courses were offered: Hotel and Restaurant Management (2 years) and Caregiver Program (7 months). All classes were held in the new building, as well.<br><br>

In the school year 2004&mdash;2005, the school celebrated its centennial year and the name was changed into Notre Dame &mdash; RVM College of Cotabato. Additional college courses were offered: Bachelor of Elementary Education and Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education with majors in English and Mathematics.<br><br>

In the school year 2013-2014,The school directress was replaced by Sister Maria Fe Gerodias,RVM.On the same year a rehabilitation was made for the Terrace 1.<br><br>

S.Y 2014-2015 was a major change in the school.The boys and girls were separated.Mother Tan Building was also under construction.80% of the school were repainted.On July 2, 2014(Wednesday) The school bus arrived on the school and is only functional for the Annual Retreat on Davao City,Philippines<br><br>

Being a Catholic Christian school in the midst of a highly Muslim-dominated populace, it takes pride in being in the formation of its people and extending its services to both Christians and Muslims alike. I still hopes to give its best as it continues to respond to the needs and realities of the present moment alongside with globalization and technology.
