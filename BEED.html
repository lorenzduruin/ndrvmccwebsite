<h1>What is BEED?</h1>
<p>Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) is a four year degree program designed to prepare students to become primary school teachers. The program combines both theory and practice in order to teach students the necessary knowledge and skills a primary school teacher needs. There are several major fields of concentration in the BEED program, namely Early Childhood Education, Special Education, General Education, English, Mathematics, Science, Filipino, Social Studies Music, Arts and Physical Education (MAPE) and Technology and Home Economics (THE). </p>
<h1>Is teaching a profession?</h1>
<p>Teaching is a profession. A graduate of BEED who passes the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) is called a Licensed Teacher. The responsibilities of an elementary teacher include establishing and enforcing rules for behavior and procedures for maintaining order, developing lesson plans and instructional materials and providing individualized and small group instruction, evaluating students&rsquo; academic and social growth, keeping appropriate records, and preparing progress reports, communicating with parents through conferences and other means to discuss students&rsquo; progress and interpret the school program and encouraging students to join extracurricular activities such as clubs, student organizations, and academic contests.

<h2>How difficult is Bachelor of Elementary Education?</h2>
<p><br>
  BEED is considered an easy course. The subjects incorporated in its curriculum are simple and easy to understand. One of the most important things when you take up this course is the desire and passion to teach. If you have this, then you will be able to finish the program smoothly. However, the most difficult part of the BEED course is the fact that you will be dealing with 6-12 old children. Children at this stage have short attention spans and will always think of play. In addition, children have varied personalities and values; often they may be difficult to understand. Your efficiency as a teacher, your patience and character will be tested when dealing with the children. </p>
