<h1>What is BSed?</h1>
<p>Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED) is a four year degree program designed to prepare students for becoming high school teachers. The program combines both theory and practice in order to teach students the necessary knowledge and skills a high school teacher needs. The BSEd program trains students to teach one of the different learning areas such as English, Mathematics, General Science, Filipino, Social Studies, Biological Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health (MAPEH) and Home Economics and Livelihood Education. </p>
<h2>Is teaching a profession?</h2>
Teaching is a profession. <br>
A graduate of BSEd who passes the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) is called a Licensed Teacher. The responsibilities of a teacher include planning, preparing and delivering effective teaching and learning programs for students in allocated classes and/or groups, establishing and maintaining a supportive school environment, monitoring, evaluating and reporting student progress, implementing strategies to achieve targets related to student learning outcomes, maintaining records of class attendance and recording student progress and supervising a range of student activities including support and welfare programs. 
<h2>What skills, traits and attitude will help you succeed in this course?</h2>
<p>The following are important characteristics that you need to possess to be able to finish the program and become a good teacher:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Being a good communicator – the ability to proficiently speak and write English and convey information to students that is easy to understand.</li>
  <li>Interpersonal skills – establishes and maintains positive mutual working relationships with students, parents and co-workers.</li>
  <li>Patience – understands student behavior, avoids temper flares and finds possible solutions to unpleasant situations.</li>
  <li>Organization – the ability to sort and arrange information in a systematic order, combine ideas and relay them to the students in a clear, concise, and logical manner.</li>
  <li>Being comfortable in public speaking – being able to speak in front of a class with 30-40 students without losing your concentration and while keeping calm and composed.</li>
  <li>Able to establish authority – being a high school or a college level teacher requires you to establish your authority and acquire the respect of your students.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How difficult is Bachelor of Secondary Education?</h2>
BSED is a fairly easy course. As long as you have the desire and passion to teach then everything will be fine. There are no complex subjects integrated in the BSEd curriculum and the workload is not that heavy. You will also have ample time to study as the course does not demand too much. The only thing that makes the course a bit difficult is the fact that it will test your character and patience. <br>
<br>
As you go for practice teaching, you will be immersed in different secondary schools and different types of students as well. These students will have varied personalities and values; often they may be difficult to understand. Being open minded, extending ones patience and avoiding biases among students will be the challenging part of the job.
